        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            It doesn't get any easier than this for a delectable mouth-watering dessert!
            The only way I see this getting any better is if it were a <i>chocolate</i> cheese cake...
            This is a dish I favor over any tradditional cake for birthdays or holidays, hands down.

            Not only does this cheesecake taste delicious, it's also low effort and beginner friendly.
            <b>Plus</b> if you find it too hard to make the crust, you can always buy the crust <i>pre-made</i>. 
            I'm sure you're up for the challenge though, so let's begin!
