# odin-recipes
First Project With "The Odin Project"

- Scope and Objectives

In this project, I will be making a recipe website to solidify the basics of HTML I've learned from The Odin Project.

I will include the use of elemnts such as headers, lists (ordered and unordered), links and images. Not to mention I will be constructing the HTML Boiler plate by memory to solidy the understadning of the basics needed to form a basic webpage.

- During the project

I have already noticed I could improve the way my code looks by utilizing the notes feature <!-- -->. I noticed this after reviewing my first recipe webpage. I will be sure to incorperate this in my next recipe webpage and see if I can make the code look better. *cross your fingers for me*
