First Project With "The Odin Project"

In this project, I will be making a website to solidify the basics of HTML I've learned from The Odin Project.

I will include the use of elemnts such as headers, lists (ordered and unordered), links and images. Not to mention I will be constructing the HTML Boiler plate by memory to solidy the understadning of the basics needed to form a basic webpage.
